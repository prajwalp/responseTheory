# responseTheory
Codes and Data for work on "Effect of perturbation on systems near extinction"

## Description of files:

### Simulation Codes - 
  1. birth_death.py - Simulating the birth and death process with absorbing boundary and calculation of response functions for average population size, variance of population size and survival probability.
  2. dna-target-search.py - Simulating the targeted search on DNA by proteins and calculation of response function for mean squared distance to the target, average position of the protein and absorption time distribution of the protein.

  Both these codes have generated arrays that can be saved.
 
### Generated Data 
  This folder contains all the generated data from the above two codes used to plot in the paper. 
 
The plotting codes are given in the Jupyter notebook plots.ipynb which uses a python kernel with a custom style file which is also given. Minor adjustments of font sizes, legend positions and axes arrows were done on the generated SVG files from the plotting code
